# Form Stepper Challenge

Your task is to take a regular form and transform it into a wizard-like workflow by dividing its content into three parts. You will be able to navigate to each part by using "Next" and "Back" buttons. This type of form is usually referred to as a "Form Stepper", "Wizard Form", or "Multi-step Form".

You may develop the stepper logic yourself or implement the [Material-UI Stepper component](https://material-ui.com/components/steppers/). Either way is acceptable.

The file you'll be editing is `src/components/PlantForm.jsx`. The form itself has already been divided into three parts and the files can be found in `src/components/form-parts`.

The form parts are named `PartA`, `PartB`, and `PartC` and each of them contains two exported constants: `label`(string) and `Form`(component containing the form fields).

The rest of the instructions are written in code comments within `src/components/PlantForm.jsx`.

Run `yarn start` from the project directory to run the app in development-mode and hot-reload any changes you make.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask us. Good luck!
