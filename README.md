# Form Stepper Challenge

Your task is to take a regular 1-page form and transform it into a wizard-like workflow by dividing its content into three parts which is navigable by using "Next" and "Back" buttons. This type of form is usually referred to as a Form Stepper.

You may develop the stepper from scratch or implement the [Material-UI Stepper component](https://material-ui.com/components/steppers/). Either way is acceptable.

The file you'll be editing is `src/components/PlantForm.jsx`. The form itself has already been divided into three parts (the files can be found in `src/components/form-parts`).

The form parts are named `PartA`, `PartB`, and `PartC` and each of them contains two exported constants: `label`(string) and `Form`(component containing the form fields).

The rest of the instructions are written in code comments within `src/components/PlantForm.jsx`.

Run `yarn start` from the project directory to run the app in development mode and hot-reload any changes you make.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask us. Good luck!
